# Datasets Folder
This folder contains all the necessary datasets to perform the full functionality of the project. It includes various data files required for training, testing, and evaluating the models. The datasets are organized into subfolders based on their type, such as raw data, preprocessed data, and model-specific inputs. Each dataset is clearly labeled with its purpose and format (CSV, JSON, etc.) to ensure easy access. Ensure that you have the correct permissions and environment setup to access and process these files effectively. Please refer to the corresponding scripts for usage details and preprocessing steps.
